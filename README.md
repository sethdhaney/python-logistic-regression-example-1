# python-logistic-regression-example-1
This example uses the public data set from 

Gorman, R. P., and Sejnowski, T. J. (1988). "Analysis of Hidden Units in a 
Layered Network Trained to Classify Sonar Targets" in Neural Networks, 
Vol. 1, pp. 75-89. 

This paper used neural network to differentiate sonar returns of rocks vs 
mines. I use this same data set with a logistic regression model to do the 
same task. This is primarily an exercise to implent logistic regression in 
python and I will not compare performance with the neural network in the
paper.
