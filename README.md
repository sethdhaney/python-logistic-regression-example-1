# python-logistic-regression-example-1
This example uses the public data set from 

Gorman, R. P., and Sejnowski, T. J. (1988). "Analysis of Hidden Units in a 
Layered Network Trained to Classify Sonar Targets" in Neural Networks, 
Vol. 1, pp. 75-89. 

This paper used neural network to differentiate sonar returns of rocks vs 
mines. We use this same data set with a logistic regression model to do the 
same task. This is primarily an exercise to implent logistic regression in 
python and we will not compare performance with the neural network in the
paper.
